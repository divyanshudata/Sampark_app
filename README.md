Sampark is an offline communication application that enables users to exchange messages without internet connectivity. It uses mesh networking concepts to allow nearby devices to connect directly and relay messages across the network, making communication possible during network outages, remote areas, or emergency situations.In many scenarios such as natural disasters, rural regions, or network failures, internet connectivity becomes unavailable. Traditional messaging apps fail under these conditions. Sampark solves this problem by enabling device-to-device communication without relying on cellular networks or the internet.
